 So far, I've learned that github is a great tool for various projects and a fantastic place for posting and sharing information. The site has a wide range of capabilities. So many, in fact, that I feel like I don't know much of anything about it. That being said it has a tremendous field of use inside and outside of the site. It allows users to post information for their own use or, perhaps, information the user feels would be useful to others. Github has a series of commands that allows it to remain useful in various text editors. Overall, it seems that github is a workflow optimization center for a busy body and an endless library of useful or not so useful information for someone who may just be browsing.
